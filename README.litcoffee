# Helicon Engine

Helicon is a modular C++ game engine built around a core-and-module architecture, designed to provide explicit control, flexibility, and scalability.

The engine consists of a central core (compiled as a dynamic library) and optional subsystems called modules. The core provides foundational systems required for all applications, while modules can be selectively included depending on project needs. This design prioritizes modularity, separation of concerns, and long-term maintainability.

---

## Design Goals

- **Modularity** — Systems are decoupled and can be added or removed without affecting the core.
- **Explicit Control** — Low-level access is preferred over heavy abstraction.
- **Scalability** — Designed to support both small and large projects.
- **Maintainability** — Clear system boundaries to reduce long-term complexity.

## Architecture Overview

Helicon is split into two main parts:

### Core
The core is always included and provides essential engine functionality. It is compiled as a dynamic library and acts as the foundation for all projects.

### Modules
Modules are optional subsystems implemented as separate dynamic libraries. They can be included as needed, allowing developers to tailor the engine to their specific use case.

---

## Core Systems

These systems are always included and form the foundation of the engine.

### Logger
Centralized logging system with support for severity levels, debugging output, and runtime diagnostics.

### Platform Layer
Abstracts platform-specific functionality such as window creation, input handling, and OS interaction, enabling cross-platform support.

### Asset / Resource System
Handles loading, caching, and lifetime management of assets (textures, models, shaders) to ensure efficient memory usage.

### Job System
Lightweight multithreading system for scheduling and executing tasks across multiple threads.

---

## Modules

Modules are optional subsystems that can be included as needed.

### UI Abstraction Layer
Provides a unified interface for UI systems (such as ImGui), allowing the underlying implementation to be swapped without affecting engine code.

### In-Game Overlay Editor
Runtime debugging and editing tools for inspecting and modifying game state in real time.

### Vulkan Rendering Abstraction Layer
Encapsulates low-level Vulkan API complexity into a structured and reusable rendering interface.

## Development Prerequisites

- C++20
- Visual Studio / CLion / Rider
- Git

---

## External Libraries

- STL
- Win32 (Windows platform layer)
- X11 (Linux platform layer)

---

## Example Naming Conventions

- `renderer-physicaldevice-milo`
- `renderer-milo` (for broader work)

---

## Project Status

Helicon is currently in active development. Core systems are being established and expanded, while modules are implemented incrementally.

---

## Philosophy

Helicon prioritizes modularity and explicit system design over heavy abstraction. The goal is to provide a flexible foundation where systems are transparent, composable, and easy to reason about.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially from students or developers interested in engine architecture and systems programming.

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
3. Make your changes with clear, focused commits  
4. Push your branch and open a pull request  

---

### Guidelines

- Keep systems modular and decoupled from the core  
- Follow existing naming conventions and code style  
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions  
- Prefer clarity and explicit behavior over “clever” solutions  

---

### Areas for Contribution

- Engine modules (rendering, UI, tools, etc.)  
- Platform layer improvements  
- Debugging and profiling tools  
- Documentation and examples

### Notes

This project is primarily developed as a learning and exploration platform for engine development. Contributions should align with the overall design goals of modularity, simplicity, and explicit control.
